        <p>The controlled process is an air-frictionless
        mass-spring-damper type second-order system. The user can insert the 
        process parameters, that is, mass m, damping coefficient c and spring constant Ks. Values of c and Ks
        can be negative. Althouh animation shows a wheeled car, the simulation assumes the mass 
        floats over the ground.
        </p>

        <p>The process variable (controlled variable) PV(t) is the mass vertical axis position, that is
        measured in meters by a hidden position indicator. The indication range is from PVmin to PVmax.
        The user can change these limits (in meters) and insert an error (in meters) in the indicated position. 
        The process is subject to the perturbation force Fp(t). The manipulated
        variable is the control force Fc(t) the final control element
        (linear motor) exerts on the process. The simulation model assumes all forces are contained
        in the mass horizontal axis.
        </p>

        <p>The controller presents the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Receives the setpoint SP(t) and the controlled variable PV(t);</li>
            <li> Computes the error e(t) = SP(t) - PV(t);</li>
            <li> Provides the output OP(t);</li>
            <li> Offers the user the following options:</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Selecting the control mode (PID, Anti-windup PID or Bistable); </li>
                <li> Directly adjusting the control force Fc(t) when in MANUAL mode; and </li>
                <li> Selecting Direct Action (DIR) or Reverse Action. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>



        <p>The diagram below shows interaction between the simulated process, control and environment.
        </p>

        <p>The basic PID structure the controller employs is defined through the following equation: 
        <br>
        <br>
        OP(t) = Kp &middot;e(t) + Ki &middot; <span>&int; </span>e(t)dt + Kd &middot; ė(t) + OPo. <br>
        <br>
        Where Ki = Kp/Ti and Kd = KpTd.</p>

        <p>Gains Kp, Ki and Kd, output OP(t) and preload OPo are
        dimensionless. SP(t), PV(t), e(t) and proportional band PB (= 1/Kp) are also dimensionless
        but are expressed in meters for convenience. The user can insert Kp, Ki, Kd, OPo and SP(t) 
        and watch the other variables. OP(t) can vary between -100% and 100%.
        </p>

        <p>
        The drawing below shows the simulator basic equations. M(t) represents the linear motor response curve.
        Fcmax is the maximum magnitude the control force Fc(t) can achieve.
        </p>

        <p>This version provides four closed-loop control modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> PID mode; </li>
            <li> PD + I if |e| &lt; eTh Anti-windup mode; </li>
            <li> PD + I if |D| &lt; DTh Anti-windup mode; and </li>
            <li> Bistable mode. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>By selecting the "PID" mode the user can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Adjust Imax to limit the integral component magnitude to a less-than-100% value; </li>
            <li> Make the derivative to be computed over PV(t) instead of e(t); </li>
            <li> Insert the derivating block output low-pass filter cutoff frequency (in Hz); and </li>
            <li> Bypass the low-pass filter. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>By choosing the "PD + I if |e| &lt; eTh" mode the user can insert the error 
        threshold magnitude eTh (in meters) that sets the integrator on. This condition is step-shaped.</p>

        <p>When choosing the "PD + I if |D| &lt; DTh" mode the user can enter the 
        derivative threshold magnitude DTh (in %) which turns the integrator on. This condition is ramp-shaped.</p>

        <p>By selecting the "Bistable" mode the user can set the deadband (in meters) and the minimum
        and maximum values of OP(t).</p>

        <p>The user can turn on/off the following screen displays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Animation; </li>
            <li> Operating envelope limits - dashed/solid red lines; </li>
            <li> PV(t) - dark teal dashed line; </li>
            <li> PV(t) indication range - orange; </li>
            <li> SP(t) - dashed blue line; and </li>
            <li> Proportional Band PB - green.</li>
        </ul>
        The last three indications, as well as the SP manual slider,
        only appear when the controller is turned on. By activating 
        the operation envelope viewing, the user is enabled to change 
        the envelope limits.

        <p>
        The linear motor receives the command OP(t) and converts it into the controlling force Fc(t) according to the motor response
        curve M(t), which can be ideal or non-ideal. The value of Fc(t) is limited to vary between -Fcmax and Fcmax. The user
        can enter the Fcmax value (in newtons) and choose motor curve type. When selecting non-ideal curve, the user can 
        insert the central slope of the curve (sigmoid) and its deadspace (in %). The user can insert the motor dead time 
        (in ms) and select Direct Action (DIR) or Reverse Action.
        </p>

        <p>
        When the controller is switched on, the simulator activates a display that shows the OP components and another display that shows
        Fc(t). Through the Fc(t) curve the user can see the shape of the motor response curve M(t).
        </p>


        <p>Setpoint SP(t) can be constant or variable. There are several available SP(t) types. The user
        can select an option and insert the limits SPmin and SPmax (in meters).</p>

        <p>Perturbation Fp(t) can be constant or variable. There are several available Fp(t) alternatives.
        The user can choose a type and enter the limits Fpmin and Fpmax, which are expressed in percentage
        of Fcmax.
        </p>


        <p>
        Through the screen upper right corner menu the user can choose a preset scenario. The user can also change 
        parameters of the selected scenario.  
        </p>

        <p>The closer the user's computer average frame rate (in FPS) gets to the expected frame rate,
        the more the simulation nears real time (see indicators displayed in the screen lower left corner).
